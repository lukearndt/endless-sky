# Section 1: Crew Settings

# Defines the various crew members that can command a ship.
# It is used to prevent a ship of a given category from being assigned
# crew members that are more senior than the ranking crew member.
# The ranking crew member for a ship is determined by its category.
#
# Specify the crew members in the command structure from highest to lowest rank.

# Defines the ranking crew member for ships of a given category.
# This is used to ensure that each ship has at least one crew member
# of the defined rank, and to prevent that ship from being assigned any
# crew members of an equal or higher rank than that.
#
# Each crew member assigned in this setting must also be included in the
# "command structure" setting, with the exception of "null".

# These settings are used to calculate the values of the "death benefit"
# and "death shares" crew fields when they are not otherwise specified.
#
# By default, death benefits are equal to one year's salary and
# a crew member gets a triple profit share on the day of their death.
#
# Death shares are only applied if the fleet makes a profit on the day
# that the crew member died. For this reason, they are unlikely to matter
# when they occur during space battles. There are two exceptions to this:
#
# 1. When the player loses one or more small ships during an otherwise
#    profitable battle.
#
# 2. When the player captures a disabled ship but crew members die in
#    the process.
#
# To help reinforce the impact of these situations, the Pilot and Marine
# crew members receive unusually high death benefits and death shares.
#
# In universe, this helps to explain why someone would be willing to
# sign up for a more vulnerable role in the fleet or proceed with a
# risky boarding operation.

# This setting determines the conversion ratio between salary and shares,
# which is used when either the "Crew salaries" or "Profit sharing"
# difficulty settings are in "converted" mode.

# Section 2: Special crew members that are required by the system.

# At the start of the game, the Player has 500 shares in the fleet; 250
# from the base value and 250 for their Pilot's License.
#
# The Player gains a flat number of shares each time they reach a new level
# of combat rating, which serves as a proxy for experience and reputation.
# This is governed by the "shares per combat level" attribute.
#
# The Player also gains a flat number of shares each time they obtain a
# license, which serves as a proxy for mission progress.
# This is governed by the "shares per license" attribute.
#
# In theory, the "name" attribute could also be used by the mission system
# to give the Player a new title as their fleet grows. As things stand
# right now, it's a bit strange that the Player is referred to as a Captain
# forever even if they command a vast fleet of warships. These title
# upgrades could also come with increases to the Player's base shares.
#
# Here's an example of how that progression might work:
#
# Starting out:
#   name: "Captain"
#   shares "250"
#
# First promotion:
#   name: "Fleet Captain"
#   shares: "500"
#
# Second promotion:
#   name: "Commodore"
#   shares: "1000"
#
# Third promotion:
#   name: "Admiral"
#   shares: "2000"
#

# Marines are the extra crew that the player can hire for boarding operations.
# They are only a little better paid than regulars, but they have unusually
# high death benefits and death shares.
#
# This helps balance out the wildly lucrative practice of capturing enemy
# ships. It also creates an incentive to minimise crew deaths during the
# capture process. After accounting for death benefits and profit shares,
# a player that throws away lives might actually lose more money than make.

# When a ship doesn't have any officers, it is commanded by a Pilot.
# Pilots are not paid much better than regulars, but they receive unusually
# high shares and death benefits.
#
# This prevents small ships from contributing to high salary costs, while
# ensuring that every gun/turret in the fleet has a meaningful impact on
# the player's profit share ratio.
#
# In universe, this helps explain why someone might choose to fly a small
# ship as part of a larger fleet. Small ships are the most vulnerable,
# making the role more dangerous than serving on a larger vessel. In return,
# the Pilot gets a higher share of the profits and more assurance that their
# family will be looked after if they are killed in action.

# Section 3: Scaling crew member definitions

# This section lists various crew members that are either placed on
# a ship as the ranking crew member based on its category, or occur due
# to the ship having a large enough crew count to require them.
#
# You may also define crew members that are not bound to the fleet's
# command structure, which is defined in the "command structure" crew
# setting at the top of this file. These non-command crew members will
# not be limited by the command structure, merely occuring as you specify.
#
# Format:
#
#   (Required fields are marked by a *; do not include the * in their defintion)
#
# "crew member" "unique crew member id" *
#   name * "Display Name; take care not to make it too long!"
#   salary * (number of credits paid per day)
#   shares * (number of shares in the fleet's profit)
#   "death benefit" (number of credits paid to their estate upon death; same day for flagship, resolved on landing and deletion for escort)
#   "death shares" (number of shares in the fleet's profit if they die; same day for flagship, until landing and deletion for escort)
#   "ship population per member" (occurs on a ship each time the crew count reaches a multiple of this number)
#   "occurs at" (occurs on a ship at these specific crew counts; list of numbers, eg 3 12 21 42)
#   "only ship categories" (only occurs on ships of these categories; list of strings, eg "Light Freighter" "Heavy Freighter")
#   "avoids escorts" (if present, will not occur on escort ships)
#   "avoids flagship" (if present, will not occur on the flagship)
#   "avoids parked" (if present, will not occur on parked ships)
#   "only parked" (if present, will only occur on parked ships)
#   "avoids ship categories" (will not occur on ships of these categories; list of strings, eg "Fighter" "Interceptor" "Drone")
#   "shares per license" (number of shares added per license obtained; only works with the Player crew member)
#   "shares per license" (number of shares added per level of combat rating; only works with the Player crew member)
#   "parked salary" (number of credits paid per day while the ship is parked)
#   "parked shares" (number of shares in the fleet's profit while the ship is parked)
#
# In the low to mid ranks, crew members receive much more salary than a
# regular but not an especially high share of the fleet's profits. This
# changes in the higher ranks, as profit shares make up an increasing
# proportion of an officer's remuneration. Various ship classes end up
# having very different cost profiles as a result:
#
# Combat:
#
#   Interceptor: Low salary, high shares.
#   Light Warship: Moderate salary, low shares.
#   Medium Warship: High salary, moderate shares.
#   Heavy Warship: Moderate salary, high shares.
#   Utility: High salary, high shares.
#   Fighter: Low salary, high shares.
#   Drone: No salary, no shares.
#
# Cargo:
#
#   Light Freighter: Low salary, high shares.
#   Heavy Freighter: Moderate salary, low shares.
#   Utility: High salary, high shares.
#
# Transport:
#
#   Transport: Low salary, high shares.
#   Space Liner: Moderate salary, low shares.
#   Utility: High salary, high shares.
#
# This gives the player an extra layer of flexibility and challenge when
# designing their fleet.
#
# Peaceful gameplay activities like cargo hauling or transport work favour
# a fleet with low salaries and high shares, as they generate reliable
# profit over several days. To achieve this, they might use a fleet of
# Heavy Freighters and minimal combat escorts.
#
# Aggressive gameplay activities like plundering and capturing enemy ships
# are the opposite, favouring a fleet with high salaries and low shares.
# This gives the player an incentive to limit their combat strength, which
# can in turn lead to more exciting and challenging battles.
#
# Mission-style gameplay often involves a lot of jumping around and
# being thrown into battles that the player can't just jump away from.
# This incentivises the player to use a fleet that's sized appropriately
# to the mission they're doing. If they trivialise the mission using a
# huge swarm of heavy warships, they'll end up paying more on salaries
# than they earn from their share of the mission rewards.
